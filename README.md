# Basket-Application
Simple Basket Application

The folder contains
- the single HTML code file called index.php
- a styles.css which holds all the CSS of the page
- operations.js where all the javascript(jQuery has been used) functions and handlers are
- a banner.jpg used as the page header
- the jquery library file

The page functionality has been carried out as described. The basket contents persist through refresh by using the session 
storage, meaning they disappear on closing the browser. The yellow 'BUY' button logs a basic XML conversion of the basket items'(basket-row) HTML to the console.
